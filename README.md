# üöÄ Bloom Filter Application

## üìñ About the Project
This project implements a URL filtering system based on a Bloom Filter.  
The application allows users to add URLs to a blacklist and check if URLs are blacklisted, using a probabilistic, memory-efficient data structure.

The program continuously reads commands from the user:
- Add a URL to the blacklist.
- Check if a URL is blacklisted.

Both the Bloom Filter and the blacklist are saved to disk after every update and automatically loaded on program startup.

### üß† What is a Bloom Filter?
A Bloom Filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.  
It allows for false positives but guarantees no false negatives, making it ideal for quick membership checks with limited memory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- C++17
- CMake
- GoogleTest (GTest) for unit testing

## üß© Command Guide

| Command Example         | Description                                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `1 www.example.com0`      | Add URL `www.example.com0` to the blacklist        |
| `2 www.example.com0`      | Check if URL `www.example.com0` is blacklisted     |
| Invalid input            | Will be ignored and skipped automatically         |

## ‚öôÔ∏è First Line Input Format
The very first line the program reads **must** define the Bloom Filter setup:
```
[array size] [repeat count for hash function 1] [repeat count for hash function 2] ...
```
- **First number**: Size of the Bloom Filter's bit array (in bits).
- **Following numbers**: How many times to apply each corresponding hash function.
- Each number after the first represents one hash function configuration.
- The total number of following numbers determines how many different hash functions are used.

**Example 1:**
```
100 1
```
- Array size: 100 bits
- 1 hash function, applied once.

**Example 2:**
```
256 2 1
```
- Array size: 256 bits
- Two hash functions:
  - The first function applied twice.
  - The second function applied once.

## üìù Notes
- Both the Bloom Filter and the blacklist are saved to disk after every update.
- On startup, the program automatically loads the previously saved Bloom Filter and blacklist.
- Invalid input lines are ignored.
- The program automatically handles false positives by checking the real blacklist when needed.
- False positives may occur, but false negatives are not possible.
- The program is designed following SOLID principles to allow future extensions.

---

## üß† Development Approach
- The project was developed using the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD).
- The code design follows SOLID principles.
- The project architecture is based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
